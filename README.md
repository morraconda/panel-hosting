File editor made to make it less annoying to manually change sources
in OBS while streaming, to update player info and scores on the fly.

If a player name is found in the database, the program matches their info (pronouns, flag)
and changes the relevant files (to be displayed on stream). If not, the name is updated 
and the rest will have to be done separately.

I have included a sample video showing the program in use with OBS.
